**Project Topic**: Business Acumen for Nursing

**Description of the Project**:

* **The problem**: Nurses/nursing units struggle with charting and do not realize the financial impact it has on the financial standing of the hospital.
* **The project**: Develop a training module for nursing called “Business Acumen” as part of nursing education. The training aims to improve charting habits (and therefore finances) while teaching nurses how their role impacts business and the profitability of the hospital.

We plan to develop learning content which includes tips for good charting, things nurses must _always_ do when charting, and how those things can significantly impact payouts from insurance companies.

Our resources for the project include a real client at the University of Utah Hospital: one specific unit who struggles most with charting to interview, educate, and pilot test the effectiveness of the learning content. We have additional resources via the commitment and support of our project from Chief Nursing Officer (CNO), CNO’s financial advisors, and Nursing Informatics and Education.
