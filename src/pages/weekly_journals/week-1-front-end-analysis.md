## Summary

Both the book chapter and video discuss the importance of conducting a thorough analysis before starting any instructional design project.

Why is analysis important? Rloyd Rieber said it best, “Instructional design will only help solve instructional problems.” Conducting a thorough front-end analysis helps prevent unnecessary work, provides clarity to goals and objectives, and improves the likelihood of meaningful learning outcomes.

The video covers Analysis, the first step of the ADDIE model. ADDIE isn’t defined in the video, but it stands for Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement and Evaluate. ADDIE is a five-phase general process framework for instructional designers and training professionals.

Using an instructional example of how to make a pepperoni pizza, the video introduces the four sub-phases of Analysis:

1. **Instructional goals** clearly define the goal of instruction
2. **Instructional analysis** identifies and defines the steps necessary for learners to meet the instructional goals
3. **Learner analysis** requires conducting research to learn what your subject already knows, or establish baseline knowledge. This might include surveys, interviews, etc.
4. **Learning objectives** outlines what learners should be able to do after completing the instruction. Importantly, learning objectives should include strong verbs indicating the desired application of knowledge, skills and/or attitude (e.g., Describe how to make pizza dough from scratch.)

The book chapter, in much greater detail than the video, outlines the processes and reasoning behind conducting front-end analysis. Topics include **performance analysis** to identify whether or not it is indeed a learning problem, importance of—and methods for—conducting a **needs assessment**, and how to bring **clarity to instructional goals** by identifying learners, context and tools, and like the video, how to draft effective instructional goal statements. The importance of having adequate resources and sponsorship to complete the project was also reinforced.

## Critiques

**Kim**: In general, I agree with the approaches presented by the authors and ADDIE model. However, I think it all depends on the scope and complexity of the project. A small learning need with a limited audience probably doesn’t warrant a full needs assessment every time. Some aspects would work under some conditions, but not in others. For example, with some online learning content, meaningful data on user needs is tough to find and the demand for content generation is high. Meeting rapid turnaround needs often trumps meaningful analysis.

**Lizz**: In general, I think ADDIE, and the approaches to instructional goals in chapter 2 make a lot of sense and help organize goal setting and keep the project in-line and on-track. However, what I don’t think the text address very well is how often (and likely) it is for multiple goal setting approaches may be useful at once for a given instructional project. Should two (or more) be relevant to one big organizational problem, it would be nice to know which typically performs better, or how to fuse and streamline approaches.

To add, I think every ID project should loop in a Subject Matter Expert. While task and job analysis, which are critical for instructional analysis, briefly states a SME could write a list of the tasks or job elements, but I feel like that is a far more valuable asset than the text leads on. It could simply warrant a quick confirmation from 1-2 other SMEs, but it could save time and resources. Especially because an non-SME designer could observe, but may not know what to observe, or may not know exactly what the tasks are. Including an SME throughout many points of the project is critical, in my opinion, mostly to ensure the content matter is correct, and the designer has not made a critical error in the instruction based on misunderstanding of content matter.

I agree with the ADDIE model, but also agree how exact is can be followed depends on the scale of the project  For example, learner analysis may be difficult with large scale target-audiences (say, a few thousand), who have a wide spectrum of prior knowledge. Neither the book, nor the ADDIE model admit, but I think it when the project is big in scale, it might be difficult to meet the needs of all learners in a given (big scale) project.

**Kyle**: Instructional design is project management focused on learning experiences. Models like ADDIE help practitioners navigate through the different stages of the project. To make an impact with any project, you need to establish scope and sequence. Performance and needs assessment, along with data, gives you that clear path forward. I agree that this is right way to go about it. Many times, especially in the corporate world, you have to put that first foot forward to propose a need anyway.

However, I don’t think moving linearly in the ADDIE framework always works. At least in a tech company, everything is moving and changing so fast, moving in a step by step fashion slows you down. I have rarely seen ADDIE work in that atmosphere. We iterate fast to learn and I feel like the model would have you stay in one step for too long.

That being said, ADDIE has been the de facto instructional design model for a reason. It gives purpose and meaning to a project. It definitely has a place in the field. I agree, especially, with any project starting with performance and needs assessment.

**Clay**: The biggest critique that I have is the notion of front-end analysis as a whole.  I’m new to instructional design, but in the software world we’ve gone down the path of doing a very front-end heavy design of software.  It has been found that it produces software that doesn’t reflect the customer's needs when it is delivered. I think this perhaps can be the the case when doing a large project using the ADDIE model. I conditionally agree with Dick and Carey when they say, “Therefore, more emphasis is being placed on front-end analysis, performance analysis, and other approaches for identifying needs more accurately.” [24]  My condition is that the piece to be designed is small enough that design to delivery is short enough to reflect the real needs of the learners at delivery.


## Self-reflections

**Kim**: I have used a number of these approaches over the course of my career, not necessarily for learning, but also for clinical research. I know firsthand the importance of setting clear goals and objectives. There have been countless instances where I have reviewed evaluation and outcomes data from health care education programs that clearly missed the mark. I have conducted a number of qualitative focus interviews and have found them to be a treasure trove of insights, but the data cleaning and management makes them extremely time intensive. I have found that the most important element is identifying the right problem to focus on from the outset. Health care is full of solution generators and training is usually the first solution generated. In order to improve our health system and train effectively, we have to become better problem solvers. Front-end analysis can help accomplish this.

**Lizz**: I recently wrote a grant proposal and it seems like foundations tend to follow a nuanced ADDIE model in how they inquire about goal settings, objectives, specific tasks associated, analysis of success, etc. I think foundations tend to lean towards this because it clearly outlines projects, and it’s easy for them to quickly analyze if a project is logical, possible, and well thought out. I also think having these requirements helps grant seekers organize their project and/or research throughout. If, before reading grant requirements, a project is not well-thought out, I think it directs principle investigators to clearly identify the needs, goals, and overall design of the project.

**Kyle**: As a ADDIE practitioner at work, I generally see it’s effectiveness for a learning project. When it comes to performance and needs assessment, it’s absolutely necessary. This is something I’ve wanted be better at. At work, as a team, we don’t spend a lot of time planning or analyzing a project. In hindsight, I’ve seen us “spin our wheels” or having to iterate more than we needed to. Not only does it waste money, it wastes people’s time and brainpower.

Spending that extra time planning and asking the right questions is pivotal. In fact, I’ve encouraged my boss to get our training team involved in the RFP (Referral for Proposal) process sooner so we can establish with a potential client what they actually need and if we can deliver according to timelines. While we are not officially doing the A in ADDIE, I feel like we can get better assessing the needs before we begin embarking on a project. Through the duration of the project, the needs should guide us through the major problems and milestones we need to meet. I look forward to see what we can do!

**Clay**: While not officially part of my day job, I’ve created trainings for other engineers at work previously. I feel like I learned a lot from the reading and class this week that I can apply to what I’ve done with trainings. I’m in the process of creating some training to help engineers create software with fewer accessibility defects. This week has helped me have ideas for evaluating the actual needs of the engineering department to more accurately make training that will help them more.
